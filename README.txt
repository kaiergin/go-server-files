These are the server files

engine.go -> the competition version of the go engine
arena -> place where go files are compiled and AI compete
one -> sample folder where AI is kept
document -> bash file that will be executed
- this compiles go files, runs python files, and reads xml files
- also moves files, deletes files/directories
edit.py -> file that changes AI functions to be different from one another
this.xml -> contains names of AIs / their rankings

When AI is uploaded (uploader must have permission)
- saves new file in designated folder
- adds file/directory name to bottom of this.xml

Will make a nicer looking, more informative readme file later
